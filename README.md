# meal_plan_grapher

## Description
Visualizes spending history and recommended budget for dining dollars and Swat points for a given Swarthmore student's meal plan. Started at Swarthmore's MLH Local Hack Day BUILD 2019 by four Swarthmore students. 

## Background & Goals
Created to help students become more financially literate. The only meal budgeting tool that exists at Swarthmore College is an excel sheet, and we wanted to be able to see trends and projections for how we've been spending to better make plans. We thought this would be useful to many students. We hope to create an app where students can log into their account, access their data, and explore the graphs.  

## Tools
* Flask app
* HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
* JavaScript, Plotly graphing library, AJAX
* Python

## Demo

* Plots random data live, as if loading in updates to the system

## Updates
Two members of the original team (Alice Huang and Jacquelyn Chow) decided to continue working on the project during the spring semester (beyond the hackathon). During the hackathon we only came up with a rough prototype in terminal, and we wanted to expand on that to build a more realistic prototype. However, we ran into challenges with gaining permissions for our application to access student data through the OneCard office. We have rethought out our concept and hope to pick up the project again once the fall 2020 semester begins and we can view our OneCard data again.
